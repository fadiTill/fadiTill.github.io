The content of your blog post goes here.
I was excited to finally make my first application, I been waiting for this moment for years! 
I had a lot of ideas of things that could be automated, I decided to create an Open House application because of a personal need: as new real estate agent, during Open house, I had to make guests sign, in order to build my pipeline of future clients. 
 however for  practical reasons, my tools were limited, I had the choice between a tablet/phone and a signing sheet, I quickly give up on the signing sheet when  I realized that I wasn't able to read people's writing, most of the time.
 Therefore  I used a free application that I found on the app store , unfortunately, it did not have all the labels and forms that I needed, the application had a lot of bugs, I was surprised to not be able to found a better free resource on the market yet...
 When I found out that I had to create an app using Sinatra  I thought of finally making my open house signing sheet MVC.
 I really enjoyed making this app and play around with CSS /HTML, it was a lot of trial and errors to figure the routes and appropriate verb; overall it is a great experience and I can't wait to work on more projects.
