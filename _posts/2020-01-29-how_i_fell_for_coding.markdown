My first encounter

Like a first crush, I first met the concept of coding in France in high school during a computer class. I vividly remember it: It was during an introduction to computer code with examples of an elevator code, we had to figure out how to instruct to go up and down in Linux language.
I must say I was hooked and intrigued by the power of coding, a few years later I was passing my baccalaureate, and we had an oral test on computer science with Excel, at the time I did not like to memorize things and found a loophole to that: Excel used simple mathematic signs to make sentence for the computer, so I just had to write whatever I was asked in plain language and replace it, I liked how natural it felt and contemplate working in computer science for a second but my limited believes got the best of me. You know because in movies “the only genius can code! Little did I know what I was doing was very similar to coding …
Despite my immaturity, it was time to decide my major, therefore the job that I will have to do for the rest of my life. Because I had a different interest I wasn’t ’t sure what to settle for so I went and a get a personality type test to help me decide. The test point to Law, business, and computer science; so I decided to apply to both Law in a prestigious University in Paris France and a technical degree in computer science in a private school. I got admitted to both, still indecisive I decide to ask my sphere and my Single mom that was graduating in computer science after many years of studying part-time time. In a consensus they agree it would be “foolish” to refuse to go to Law school, that was an opportunity of a lifetime! Like many, I decided to listen to my good intention sphere and my fears.
 
My reunion with coding

Fast forward many lives later… I ‘m now a stay at home mom of a baby and a toddler with a Law degree and living in another country USA. I changed a lot and matured and acquired a lot of soft skills, but I still dream of knowing how to code and maybe make it a career, but where to start? so I did what we all do and ask my best friend at the time Google! and found a lot of free class and advice on how too do, but still where to start witch languages to learn first? 
After watching a lot of tutorials signing for some free introductions and finishing few, I was still learning too slowly, and still did not know how to code, yes I had a general idea and understanding how that work and create an easy project with scratch but I was still far from calling myself a software engineer, so I kind of give up and failed or did I?               This failure taught me a lot about my learning style and the importance of structure, and community, and to sometimes simply ask for help. 
In my quest to learn I found career Karma ( I ‘m not sponsored) but it was eyes opening, there I found people with a similar story a community that believes in me and share knowledge and struggle, there I got closer to my dream, there I found flatiron school with the same Win-win culture.

My new journey with coding 

 Here I am today: currently, a real estate agent and my children are kids now, on days 3 of my Bootcamp starting software developing all other again with something different this time, I now know that my dream can become reality, and I ‘m determinate to make it a career!
