The CLI project is my first individual project, the goal was to scrape an API I and create a  two layers search CLI app
At first, it seems simple enough the coach tutorial was clear and well explained. 
However, as I start the project, I quickly realized it wasn’t ’t that simple …. I struggle in every step making trivial mistakes that got me stuck for days…. 
My first issue was with setting up the sandbox for my application and running it in a new repository, after founding tutorial I was finally able to start my project. 
 My second issue was to found an API without a key and authentification, or to figure how to hide in my environment and access this information for future users without reveling it…. After a lot of struggle, I decided to avoid Keys at all cost for my first project even though I was starting to understand how to do and found some tools like “postman” last but not least finally start my project and write the code, here again, I struggle with files at the wrong place, missing karma and so on….. After days of hard work, I finally achieve my first project and now can’t wait to use my new power on a new personal project. So I guess most of us will struggle but it is a part of the process, the important is to work harder and not give up!
