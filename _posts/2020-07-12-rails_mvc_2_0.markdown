For this project, I decided to improve my code  and the user's experience of my prior open house MVC using the Rails framework, and follow  the CRUD:
This MVC allows users to create Open houses and save the information of the guests that visit it.

A/ How I plan and made my code dry

1) Plan Models according to the story
The most challenging part of this project was to plan the Models and figure the different relationships and implement them with the correct database,  controller, and routes.
 
 Models 
the Models are Users, Houses, and Guests

class Guest 
	 
	 belongs_to :user
	 belongs_to :house

class House 
	 has_many :guests
	 has_many :users, through: :guests


 has_many :guests 
      has_many :guests 
     has_many :houses, through: :guests


class GuestsController < ApplicationController
 def destroy
	 @house = House.find(params[:house_id])
	 @guest = @house.guests.find(params[:id])
	 @guest.destroy
	 redirect_to house_path(@house)
	 end

2/ avoid repetitions

a/I Used Rails form helpers 

 <%= link_to 
 <%= form_with 
<%= form_for 
 
b/I refactored my code using helper methods 
before_action :require_login

 I also  used  partial form 
<%= render partial: 'form'%>



B/ How I improve the user experience 

1/ aumniauth
I use social media aumniauth  gem in order to simplify the MVC accessibility.

2/better presentation
To improve the user experience I had a  picture of the layout so it can yield throughout the application 

<body>

 <%= image_tag("home-real-estate-106399.jpg",style:"height: 200px; width:1000px")%>

 <%= yield %>
 </body>
</html>


3/nested resources
 One of the requirements was to create a nested resources, it created new routes that are more users friendly.

resources :houses do
	 resources :guests, only: [ :new, :create, :show, :index, :destroy ]
	end

Nested  Rails routes 
 new_house_guest GET    /houses/:house_id/guests/new(.:format)                                                   guests#new
                          house_guest GET    /houses/:house_id/guests/:id(.:format)                                                   guests#show
                                      DELETE /houses/:house_id/guests/:id(.:format)                                                   guests#destroy


It was interesting to see how I could improve my project using a more powerful framework, I 'm excited to learn more and further improve my original project
ruby.
