The content of your blog post goes here.

A bit of prerequisite to start, or how I feel about Ruby. I Like Ruby because it is User friendly, Ruby seems to be built to facilitate coding, it is logical and easily readable if you speak English... 

What I will recommend to a newbie, 
1) Read the lessons and take the time to fully understand concepts and vocabulary, take note when you can..
2)Ask for help from a coach or a peer when you need it, the sooner the better.
3)Use GOOGLE!
4) practice, practice, practice ...
5) take Brakes, sometimes the solution arises when you expect it the less.
At Last, it is ok to not understand things fully at first, sometimes your brain needs to process the information, and despite how it may feel you not alone we all go through the same pattern of feeling like coding rock start to a failure...  

Good luck in your journey!
