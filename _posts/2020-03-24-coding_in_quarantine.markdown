This past week been extremely stressful, Kids school is close and now we have to homeschool and care for our kids,  hunt for toilette paper, food, and work from home. 

Thankfully I 'm not new to homeschooling but it is time-consuming, I do my best to code in my spare time and keeping up with the schedule...
Thankfully Flatiron did some adjustments but would they be enough if this situation persists? 

I keep wondering how anybody else holding during this time? some people lost their jobs and need to found a new one just to pay their bills, some people are single parents, some people got sick,  people are separate from their loved ones, some people depress... 
I wish that at during this stressful time, Flatiron will ask us, student, how to support us to make sure we succeed...

I was thinking maybe  ISA for self peace student will make things so much easier for most because it will leave time to adjust without adding more expense that most can"t afford and remove the stress from the urgency to finish every week on time to not be behind .....

I understand It is an exceptional situation and it takes some time to adjust, I believe that flatiron will continue to adapt as this situation evolve and will take the best decision for his student.
